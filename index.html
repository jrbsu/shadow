				<p class="hidden-md hidden-lg" id="hiddenlede">Bul&shy;garia has the largest un&shy;declared, or shad&shy;ow, eco&shy;nomy in the European Uni&shy;on. Some re&shy;ports in&shy;dic&shy;ate as much as a third of the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an eco&shy;nomy is un&shy;dis&shy;closed, which im&shy;pacts the coun&shy;try’s repu&shy;ta&shy;tion on a glob&shy;al stage.<br />What to do in the face of this trend is a grow&shy;ing con&shy;cern.</p>
<p class="lede">Bul&shy;garia’s shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy is the largest in the European Uni&shy;on. <a href="www.atkearney.com/en_GB/financial-institutions/featured-article/-/asset_publisher/j8IucAqMqEhB/content/the-shadow-economy-in-europe-2013/10192">A re&shy;port</a> by Friedrich Schneider, PhD, at the Uni&shy;versity of Linz in Aus&shy;tria, pub&shy;lished last year, es&shy;tim&shy;ates that, of the €41bn that made up Bul&shy;garia’s GDP in 2013, around €13bn was un&shy;declared.</p><p>
</p><p>That means that 31.2 per cent of eco&shy;nom&shy;ic activ&shy;ity in Bul&shy;garia is per&shy;formed be&shy;hind closed doors, away from the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</p>
<p>This is of course alarm&shy;ing for both Bul&shy;gari&shy;an in&shy;terests and their European in&shy;teg&shy;ra&shy;tion, but it calls in&shy;to ques&shy;tion the coun&shy;try’s clean&shy;li&shy;ness and eco&shy;nom&shy;ic prestige dur&shy;ing a vi&shy;tal re&shy;devel&shy;op&shy;ment peri&shy;od for the EU.</p>

<h2 id="heading1"><b>What</b> is it?</h2>
<p class="open">At its most ba&shy;sic, the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy<wbr>—of&shy;ten called the in&shy;form&shy;al, grey or even non-ob&shy;served eco&shy;nomy, though the terms tend to be in&shy;ter&shy;change&shy;able</wbr><wbr>—refers to the sec&shy;tion of a coun&shy;try’s GDP that is not de&shy;clared to the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment.</wbr></p>
<p>Teodor Sed&shy;larski is the Vice Dean for Aca&shy;dem&shy;ic Af&shy;fairs and In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al Re&shy;la&shy;tions at the Uni&shy;versity of Sofia. He sits be&shy;hind his desk in a small, book-laden room on the fifth floor of the De&shy;part&shy;ment of Eco&shy;nom&shy;ics.</p>
<p>“You don’t get taxes from the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy. This is the prob&shy;lem,” he says. “The most in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing ques&shy;tion is how you fight that.”</p>
<p>Between Bul&shy;garia’s na&shy;tion&shy;al gov&shy;ern&shy;ment and the European Com&shy;mis&shy;sion, nu&shy;mer&shy;ous meth&shy;ods for fight&shy;ing the rise in the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy have been im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ted.</p>
<p>“Every&shy;body was pay&shy;ing the min&shy;im&shy;um wage for all their people in all sec&shy;tors, and then the oth&shy;er part of the salary was paid cash,” ex&shy;plains Sed&shy;larski. “So even if you were in the nor&shy;mal eco&shy;nomy, you were of&shy;fi&shy;cially get&shy;ting the min&shy;im&shy;um wage, but you were get&shy;ting ten times more in cash.”</p>

<p>Yavor Alex&shy;iev from the <a href="http://ime.bg">In&shy;sti&shy;tute of Mar&shy;ket Eco&shy;nom&shy;ists</a> in Sofia, also points out that there is a large gulf in in&shy;come equal&shy;ity between the cap&shy;it&shy;al, Sofia, and the rest of the coun&shy;try.</p>
<p>“[This], coupled with the coun&shy;try-wide fixed rate of so&shy;cial se&shy;cur&shy;ity pay&shy;ments in dif&shy;fer&shy;ent eco&shy;nom&shy;ic activ&shy;it&shy;ies, force smal&shy;ler com&shy;pan&shy;ies from the coun&shy;tryside to quickly lose com&shy;pet&shy;it&shy;ive&shy;ness,” he ex&shy;plains.</p>
<p>“In some cases, [they] en&shy;gage in un&shy;declared activ&shy;it&shy;ies in or&shy;der to re&shy;main act&shy;ive.”</p>
<p>Some ana&shy;lysts point out that eco&shy;nom&shy;ic activ&shy;ity that is not doc&shy;u&shy;mented can still be&shy;ne&shy;fit Bul&shy;garia, des&shy;pite the im&shy;pact on tax rev&shy;en&shy;ues.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
<p>“It’s very hard to es&shy;tim&shy;ate the over&shy;all im&shy;pact, be&shy;cause from one point of view of course you can say that you have neg&shy;at&shy;ive in&shy;flu&shy;ence be&shy;cause of the lower tax col&shy;lec&shy;tion,” says To&shy;dor Yalam&shy;ov, eco&shy;nom&shy;ic ana&shy;lyst at the polit&shy;ic&shy;al think tank the <a href="http://csd.bg">Cen&shy;ter for the Study of Demo&shy;cracy</a> (CSD).</p>
<p>“But at the same time, non-ob&shy;served eco&shy;nom&shy;ic activ&shy;ity might be con&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing to eco&shy;nom&shy;ic growth in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar areas, or in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar groups, who have dif&shy;fi&shy;culties in&shy;teg&shy;rat&shy;ing through the form&shy;al la&shy;bour mar&shy;ket.”</p>
<p>“By hav&shy;ing ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al jobs in the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy, they might ac&shy;tu&shy;ally be less de&shy;pend&shy;ant on the so&shy;cial se&shy;cur&shy;ity sys&shy;tem, which means that while the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment is lack&shy;ing rev&shy;en&shy;ues, at the same time they’re sav&shy;ing on some so&shy;cial pro&shy;grams that oth&shy;er&shy;wise would have been ne&shy;ces&shy;sary.”</p>

<p>Pro&shy;fess&shy;or of pub&shy;lic policy at the Uni&shy;versity of Shef&shy;field, Colin C. Wil&shy;li&shy;ams, PhD, did an in&shy;vest&shy;ig&shy;a&shy;tion in&shy;to the mo&shy;tiv&shy;a&shy;tions be&shy;hind those par&shy;ti&shy;cip&shy;at&shy;ing in the in&shy;form&shy;al eco&shy;nomy in the European Uni&shy;on. Ac&shy;cord&shy;ing to <a href="http://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/viewFile/496/405">his re&shy;search (PDF)</a>, pub&shy;lished in the Journ&shy;al for Con&shy;tem&shy;por&shy;ary European Re&shy;search, around half of those ques&shy;tioned felt “both parties be&shy;nefited” from the un&shy;declared work, and al&shy;most a quarter said they could not find work in the reg&shy;u&shy;lar eco&shy;nomy.</p>
<p>Not&shy;ably, al&shy;most one in six said that un&shy;declared work was “com&shy;mon prac&shy;tice in this re&shy;gion or sec&shy;tor so there is no real al&shy;tern&shy;at&shy;ive”, while only one in eight ar&shy;gued taxes were too high.</p>
<p>Sed&shy;larski notes that the lib&shy;er&shy;al view of the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy is far more ac&shy;cept&shy;ing. “I know European eco&shy;nom&shy;ists that are lib&shy;er&shy;al, and they ask, ‘what is the bad thing about hav&shy;ing a shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy?’,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s still pro&shy;du&shy;cing in&shy;come, and okay, the state doesn’t get any&shy;thing from that, but it still gives money to people. It’s pro&shy;du&shy;cing. You see this kind of thing in eco&shy;nom&shy;ic text&shy;books. The mafia is kind of struc&shy;tur&shy;ing eco&shy;nom&shy;ic activ&shy;ity but in a dif&shy;fer&shy;ent way. The state doesn’t in&shy;ter&shy;fere there, the mafia it&shy;self is the state that makes the rules and gives the in&shy;come to people.”</p>
<p>While use&shy;ful to provide eco&shy;nom&shy;ic con&shy;text for the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy’s pre&shy;val&shy;ence, it is also a good ex&shy;ample of the cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in the coun&shy;try that in&shy;flu&shy;ences this trend.</p>

<p class="open">There is a tan&shy;gible per&shy;cep&shy;tion of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in Bul&shy;gari&shy;an polit&shy;ics among the pub&shy;lic, and in&shy;deed throughout the rest of Europe. It is cer&shy;tainly not something that is unique to Bul&shy;garia. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report/index_en.htm">A re&shy;port by the European Com&shy;mis&shy;sion in Feb&shy;ru&shy;ary</a>, the first of its kind deal&shy;ing with the top&shy;ic of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in the EU, found that the true cost of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion was €120bn per year.</p>
<p>Over a quarter of re&shy;spond&shy;ents said someone had “asked or ex&shy;pec&shy;ted someone from your com&shy;pany to pay a bribe” at least once. The EU av&shy;er&shy;age was 5 per cent.</p>
<p>Bul&shy;garia broadly per&shy;formed bet&shy;ter in the sur&shy;vey than oth&shy;er coun&shy;tries in Europe’s peri&shy;phery, such as Por&shy;tugal, Greece and Italy, but 84 per cent of those sur&shy;veyed con&shy;sidered cor&shy;rup&shy;tion to be “wide&shy;spread”.</p>

<p>“The fact that pub&shy;lic opin&shy;ion to&shy;wards the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment is low is highly re&shy;lated to the fact that cor&shy;rup&shy;tion re&shy;mains an un&shy;re&shy;solved is&shy;sue, des&shy;pite pub&shy;lic rhet&shy;or&shy;ic and ‘ac&shy;tions’ in the op&shy;pos&shy;ite dir&shy;ec&shy;tion,” says Filip Lipev, eco&shy;nom&shy;ic and polit&shy;ic&shy;al ana&shy;lyst at <a href="https://www.ceemarketwatch.com/">CEEMarket&shy;Watch</a>.</p>
<p>“Cor&shy;rup&shy;tion is well spread in our coun&shy;try. It is not only in pub&shy;lic ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion, it is in po&shy;lice, health&shy;care, edu&shy;ca&shy;tion, and so on. So, one would say that we have a big prob&shy;lem with that.”</p>
<p>“I would say this is one of the main reas&shy;ons why the state lags be&shy;hind many EU coun&shy;tries in real GDP per cap&shy;ita, etcet&shy;era. If we tackle cor&shy;rup&shy;tion prob&shy;lems more ef&shy;fect&shy;ively, we would be&shy;come much wealth&shy;i&shy;er, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>In the Com&shy;mis&shy;sion’s sur&shy;vey, only one in ten Bul&shy;gari&shy;ans agreed with the state&shy;ment that “there are enough suc&shy;cess&shy;ful pro&shy;sec&shy;u&shy;tions in Bul&shy;garia to de&shy;ter people from cor&shy;rupt prac&shy;tices”. This is the low&shy;est fig&shy;ure in the Uni&shy;on. And in <a href="http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/">the Glob&shy;al Cor&shy;rup&shy;tion Per&shy;cep&shy;tion In&shy;dex 2013</a>, or&shy;gan&shy;ised by Trans&shy;par&shy;ency In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tion&shy;al, Bul&shy;garia ranked 77th with a “clean&shy;li&shy;ness” score of 41.

<p>Slavi Binev is a na&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ist politi&shy;cian who was elec&shy;ted to the European Par&shy;lia&shy;ment as a mem&shy;ber of na&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ist party Ataka. He cur&shy;rently rep&shy;res&shy;ents the right-wing Na&shy;tion&shy;al Front for the Sal&shy;va&shy;tion of Bul&shy;garia. He says that the pub&shy;lic per&shy;cep&shy;tion of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in Bul&shy;garia is en&shy;tirely ac&shy;cur&shy;ate.</p>
<p>“Many of these people [in the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an gov&shy;ern&shy;ment] did not have any busi&shy;ness activ&shy;ity be&shy;fore that,” he says, “and when they leave their gov&shy;ern&shy;ment&shy;al posts, they walk out with eco&shy;nom&shy;ic em&shy;pires, banks and be&shy;come parts of the busi&shy;ness elite.”</p>
<p>“The shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy could not ex&shy;ist without the um&shy;brella from the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment,” he adds. “It is part of the cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in the coun&shy;try.”</p>
<p>Dutch MEP Soph&shy;ie in ’t Veld, who rep&shy;res&shy;ents the pro&shy;gress&shy;ive left-lean&shy;ing Demo&shy;crats 66 in the Neth&shy;er&shy;lands, <a href="http://www.euroviews.eu/2014/04/22/bulgaria-made-to-wait-for-schengen-access/">says</a> the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an gov&shy;ern&shy;ment’s in&shy;ac&shy;tion makes it hard for their fel&shy;low EU mem&shy;ber states to sup&shy;port them in the face of rising pop&shy;u&shy;lism.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
<p>“I am a staunch de&shy;fend&shy;er of the ac&shy;ces&shy;sion of Bul&shy;garia and Ro&shy;mania to the EU, to Schen&shy;gen, and to everything else that we are part of,” she says, “but I also think that they are mak&shy;ing it very dif&shy;fi&shy;cult for their sup&shy;port&shy;ers, for their al&shy;lies like me, to de&shy;fend their po&shy;s&shy;i&shy;tion if they’re not more vig&shy;or&shy;ous in fight&shy;ing cor&shy;rup&shy;tion and mak&shy;ing their ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;trat&shy;ive sys&shy;tems work bet&shy;ter.”</p>
<p>“People see Bul&shy;garia and Ro&shy;mania like they shouldn’t be in the European Uni&shy;on. Which I think is usu&shy;ally un&shy;fair, and largely un&shy;foun&shy;ded. But again, Bul&shy;gari&shy;an and Ro&shy;mani&shy;an gov&shy;ern&shy;ments make it very easy for oth&shy;ers to cri&shy;ti&shy;cise them.”</p>
<p>While cor&shy;rup&shy;tion is wide&shy;spread in east&shy;ern European states, Bul&shy;garia’s mem&shy;ber&shy;ship of the European Uni&shy;on means this is&shy;sue is placed un&shy;der fur&shy;ther scru&shy;tiny. Since join&shy;ing in 2007, there has been some level of dis&shy;trust among politi&shy;cians in oth&shy;er mem&shy;ber states who are op&shy;posed to ex&shy;pan&shy;sion.</p>

<p>Anti-im&shy;mig&shy;ra&shy;tion parties, such as the Free&shy;dom Party in the Neth&shy;er&shy;lands, Front Na&shy;tion&shy;al in France and the United King&shy;dom In&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ence Party (Ukip), have been vo&shy;cal in their op&shy;pos&shy;i&shy;tion to fur&shy;ther ex&shy;pan&shy;sion.</p>
<p>When bor&shy;ders opened to Ro&shy;mani&shy;an and Bul&shy;gari&shy;an cit&shy;izens at the start of this year, Ukip used this to their ad&shy;vant&shy;age and were in&shy;volved in a hos&shy;tile me&shy;dia cam&shy;paign warn&shy;ing of the dangers an in&shy;flux in mi&shy;grant work&shy;ers would carry.</p>
<p>“The gen&shy;er&shy;al sen&shy;ti&shy;ment among people is hes&shy;it&shy;ant at best, and fear for job losses and so&shy;cial se&shy;cur&shy;ity tour&shy;ism holds sway, which is, by the way, not or barely re&shy;flec&shy;ted in the fig&shy;ures on the European la&shy;bour mar&shy;ket presen&shy;ted by the Com&shy;mis&shy;sion,” says Dutch MEP Ju&shy;dith Merkies, who rep&shy;res&shy;ents the La&shy;bour Party of the Neth&shy;er&shy;lands in the European Par&shy;lia&shy;ment.</p>

<h2 id="heading3"><b>Curbing</b> the trend</h2>
<p class="open">In 2007, the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an gov&shy;ern&shy;ment im&shy;ple&shy;men&shy;ted a flat tax rate of ten per cent for cor&shy;por&shy;a&shy;tions, a fourfold de&shy;crease from ten years earli&shy;er. This has en&shy;cour&shy;aged many or&shy;gan&shy;isa&shy;tions to de&shy;clare what they per&shy;haps wouldn’t have be&shy;fore.</p>
<p>The per&shy;son&shy;al in&shy;come tax rate in Bul&shy;garia is also a flat ten per cent, which is by far the low&shy;est level in the EU. In west&shy;ern and north&shy;ern Europe, the rate for top earners can be as high as 57 per cent (in Sweden).</p>
<p>“Of course it’s a prob&shy;lem for all the European coun&shy;tries,” says Ivailo Kalfin, who was Min&shy;is&shy;ter of For&shy;eign Af&shy;fairs of Bul&shy;garia from 2005 to 2009, and is cur&shy;rently a Mem&shy;ber of the European Par&shy;lia&shy;ment (MEP) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Socialist_Party">Bul&shy;gari&shy;an So&shy;cial&shy;ist Party</a>.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say that Bul&shy;garia is an ex&shy;treme ex&shy;ample,” he adds, “just the op&shy;pos&shy;ite, be&shy;cause we have quite low taxes, and with low taxes you have much bet&shy;ter in&shy;cent&shy;ive to be in the leg&shy;al eco&shy;nomy, the light, and pay your taxes rather than go out&shy;side of it.”</p>
<p>“Des&shy;pite rap&shy;idly fall&shy;ing em&shy;ploy&shy;ment levels and rising un&shy;em&shy;ploy&shy;ment, per&shy;son&shy;al in&shy;come tax has in fact been the only tax to gen&shy;er&shy;ate high&shy;er rev&shy;en&shy;ues in the most dif&shy;fi&shy;cult years of 2009-10,” says Alex&shy;iev.</p>
<p>“In our view, this was due en&shy;tirely to the in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion of a flat in&shy;come tax rate from the start of 2008, which ob&shy;vi&shy;ously led to re&shy;duc&shy;tion of the in&shy;form&shy;al eco&shy;nomy in labor con&shy;tracts.”</p>

<p>But Aleksandar Di&shy;mitrov, PhD, and chief polit&shy;ic&shy;al ana&shy;lyst at the Centre of His&shy;tor&shy;ic&shy;al and Polit&shy;ic&shy;al Stud&shy;ies, points out that the meas&shy;ures could have gone fur&shy;ther to help deal with the prob&shy;lem.</p>
<p>“They prom&shy;ised that they would change it to multi-level tax, rising level tax with the in&shy;come of the per&shy;son,” he ex&shy;plains. “But we still have ten per cent tax. They didn’t change it. I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>“I think the prime min&shy;is&shy;ter [in&shy;de&shy;pend&shy;ent politi&shy;cian Pla&shy;men Oresharski] be&shy;lieves in the flat tax. But the so&shy;cial&shy;ist party don’t be&shy;lieve in the flat tax. No ac&shy;tu&shy;al dia&shy;logue about the stra&shy;tegic tax policy [between the two parties].”</p>
<p>The so&shy;cial&shy;ist party is the second party in Bul&shy;garia and the lead&shy;ing part of the Co&shy;ali&shy;tion for Bul&shy;garia. It cur&shy;rently serves as the op&shy;pos&shy;i&shy;tion to the rul&shy;ing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_European_Development_of_Bulgaria">Cit&shy;izens for European De&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ment of Bul&shy;garia</a>, a more con&shy;ser&shy;vat&shy;ive party.</p>
<p>A staggered min&shy;im&shy;um wage was also in&shy;tro&shy;duced as a solu&shy;tion for com&shy;batting the size of the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy, as Sed&shy;larski ex&shy;plains.</p>
<p>“One thing was to set min&shy;im&shy;um wages for dif&shy;fer&shy;ent pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al areas,” says Sed&shy;larski. “And that ac&shy;tu&shy;ally helped. A lot of firms have to de&shy;clare how many work&shy;ers they have and they have to pay the so&shy;cial se&shy;cur&shy;ity for them at a cer&shy;tain min&shy;im&shy;um level.”</p>

<p>Min&shy;im&shy;um wage is now a flat 340 lev (around €174) per month, which equates to about 2.03 lev (€1.04) per hour. This is the low&shy;est such fig&shy;ure in the European Uni&shy;on.</p>
<p>“People em&shy;ploy&shy;ing law&shy;yers could not pay them the min&shy;im&shy;um wage, they’d pay them some five times that. You had a lot more people em&shy;ployed after this meas&shy;ure, on a wage that was big&shy;ger than the min&shy;im&shy;um.”</p>
<p>Sed&shy;larski also talks about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton Con&shy;sensus</a>, a set of ten eco&shy;nom&shy;ic policy pre&shy;scrip&shy;tions ap&shy;plied to, among oth&shy;ers, the former So&shy;viet states in the early nineties. “We hos&shy;ted a pro&shy;fess&shy;or at Har&shy;vard re&shy;cently, and he gave a lec&shy;ture about how it was ac&shy;tu&shy;ally something very stu&shy;pid, and that we should have had in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tion&shy;al re&shy;forms.”</p>
<p>“We have seen that we should have giv&shy;en more at&shy;ten&shy;tion to in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions. Rules, laws… they were miss&shy;ing. The eco&shy;nomy, after the changes, evolved as something il&shy;leg&shy;al. From the be&shy;gin&shy;ning, everything was ini&shy;tially privat&shy;ised by dir&shy;ect&shy;ors, as in all So&shy;viet states. Everything was part leg&shy;al, part il&shy;leg&shy;al.”</p>

<p>Alex&shy;iev says his or&shy;gan&shy;isa&shy;tion, the In&shy;sti&shy;tute for Mar&shy;ket Eco&shy;nom&shy;ists, took part in a pro&shy;ject “fo&shy;cused on identi&shy;fy&shy;ing and trans&shy;fer&shy;ring best prac&shy;tices in the fight against the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy from oth&shy;er coun&shy;tries with&shy;in the European Uni&shy;on”.</p>
<p>Of the 20 pro&shy;pos&shy;als they put for&shy;ward, some are com&shy;mon sense. Es&shy;tab&shy;lish&shy;ing a leg&shy;al defin&shy;i&shy;tion for “un&shy;declared work”, for in&shy;stance, as well as cam&shy;paigns to in&shy;crease the aware&shy;ness of the im&shy;pact of the grey mar&shy;ket.</p>
<p>Some seem a little more chal&shy;len&shy;ging. One such sug&shy;ges&shy;tion is to cre&shy;ate a re&shy;gistry of law-abid&shy;ing com&shy;pan&shy;ies which would then be af&shy;forded dif&shy;fer&shy;ent ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;trat&shy;ive priv&shy;ileges, while an&shy;oth&shy;er seeks to craft a set of hir&shy;ing pro&shy;ced&shy;ures for busi&shy;nesses to help them avoid ac&shy;ci&shy;dent&shy;ally con&shy;trib&shy;ut&shy;ing to the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy.</p>
<p>For the most part, these meas&shy;ures ap&shy;pear to have worked. The shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy in Europe has been slowly and con&shy;sist&shy;ently shrink&shy;ing over the past dec&shy;ade.</p>

<p>“If you com&shy;pare 2003, pre-ac&shy;ces&shy;sion, and after ac&shy;ces&shy;sion in 2007, the levels of shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy are sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;antly lower,” says To&shy;dor Yalam&shy;ov.</p>
<p>“In 2013 there was alarm&shy;ing in&shy;dic&shy;at&shy;ors that the eco&shy;nomy was not do&shy;ing well, and a lot of people were en&shy;gaged in shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy activ&shy;it&shy;ies as a re&shy;sponse to that, es&shy;pe&shy;cially those that re&shy;turned from oth&shy;er EU coun&shy;tries.”
				</p><p>“But the macro-trend is pos&shy;it&shy;ive.”</p>
<p>“Bul&shy;gari&shy;an labor mar&shy;kets are not flex&shy;ible enough, which makes many em&shy;ploy&shy;ers and em&shy;ploy&shy;ees re&shy;luct&shy;ant to de&shy;clare their labor re&shy;la&shy;tions in or&shy;der to avoid long ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;trat&shy;ive pro&shy;ced&shy;ures and ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al costs,” Alex&shy;iev says.</p>
<p>“The con&shy;tinu&shy;ing so&shy;cial and polit&shy;ic&shy;al tur&shy;moil in the coun&shy;try is a prob&shy;lem, since polit&shy;ic&shy;al ap&shy;point&shy;ments in key state in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions lower their ca&shy;pa&shy;city in the fight against the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy.”</p>

<h2 id="heading4"><b>European</b> impact</h2>
<p class="open">As part of their re&shy;port in&shy;to cor&shy;rup&shy;tion, the European Uni&shy;on re&shy;leased a set of guidelines ad&shy;dressed to the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an gov&shy;ern&shy;ment for how to man&shy;age and pre&shy;vent cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in the fu&shy;ture.</p>
<p>Among these is to es&shy;tab&shy;lish anti-cor&shy;rup&shy;tion reg&shy;u&shy;lat&shy;ors, shiel&shy;ded from the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, as well as codes of eth&shy;ics for mem&shy;bers of the Na&shy;tion&shy;al As&shy;sembly.</p>
<p>“[The Cen&shy;ter for the Study of Demo&shy;cracy is] also closely mon&shy;it&shy;or&shy;ing the levels of cor&shy;rup&shy;tion in dif&shy;fer&shy;ent EU in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions,” Yalam&shy;ov says.</p>
<p>“The in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions that were ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;en&shy;cing pos&shy;it&shy;ive trends after European Uni&shy;on ac&shy;ces&shy;sion are dir&shy;ectly linked with the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy, which means that par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar areas like smug&shy;gling and the levels of tax col&shy;lec&shy;tion sig&shy;ni&shy;fic&shy;antly im&shy;proved after the ac&shy;ces&shy;sion.

<p>But Slavi Binev is highly crit&shy;ic&shy;al of the EU re&shy;sponse.</p>
<p>“I be&shy;lieve that it is not good for the European Uni&shy;on to close its eyes and not to in&shy;ter&shy;fere to de&shy;fend the Bul&shy;gari&shy;an cit&shy;izens from the con&shy;trolled dic&shy;tat&shy;or&shy;ship they are sub&shy;jec&shy;ted to,” Binev says.</p>
<p>“I think that the non-in&shy;ter&shy;fer&shy;ence of the EU shows its hy&shy;po&shy;crisy and its double stand&shy;ards. It turns out that Europe could in&shy;ter&shy;fere in North Africa, in Crimea and every&shy;where else in the world but when it comes to its own yard, it re&shy;mains si&shy;lent.”</p>
<p>“This un&shy;der&shy;mines the EU in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions, and not people who want their free&shy;dom.”</p>
<p>Ex&shy;actly how the European Uni&shy;on in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions can deal with the size of the shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy in Bul&shy;garia, and the cor&shy;rup&shy;tion that goes with it, is not clear. In this situ&shy;ation it seems that the na&shy;tion&shy;al gov&shy;ern&shy;ments must take the ini&shy;ti&shy;at&shy;ive.</p>
<p>Yavor Alex&shy;iev con&shy;cedes that Bul&shy;garia’s eco&shy;nomy is per&shy;haps too small for their shad&shy;ow eco&shy;nomy to really im&shy;pact on European stat&shy;ist&shy;ics<wbr>—the coun&shy;try’s out&shy;put ac&shy;coun&shy;ted for just 0.3 per cent of EU-wide GDP in 2013, and per cap&shy;ita is one of the poorest eco&shy;nom&shy;ies in the 28.</wbr></p>
<p>“Most un&shy;declared activ&shy;it&shy;ies hap&shy;pen at small and me&shy;di&shy;um-sized en&shy;ter&shy;prises that op&shy;er&shy;ate on the loc&shy;al level, where com&shy;pet&shy;i&shy;tion from oth&shy;er coun&shy;tries is prac&shy;tic&shy;ally nonex&shy;ist&shy;ent,” he says.</p>
<p>Lipev, however, has a rad&shy;ic&shy;al solu&shy;tion from Europe’s side.</p>
<p>“I strongly be&shy;lieve that what the [Com&shy;mis&shy;sion] needs to do with Bul&shy;garia to tackle this is&shy;sue and put more ser&shy;i&shy;ous pres&shy;sure is simply to stop its EU funds to the coun&shy;try,” he says.</p>
<p>“This will have a ser&shy;i&shy;ous neg&shy;at&shy;ive im&shy;pact on the coun&shy;try and will al&shy;most cer&shy;tainly lead to a so&shy;cial out&shy;cry, thus put&shy;ting much&shy;needed strong pres&shy;sure on politi&shy;cians to act and take more ef&shy;fect&shy;ive meas&shy;ures.”</p>
<p>“Such kind of sanc&shy;tions could do the work, in my opin&shy;ion. Oth&shy;er&shy;wise, the pro&shy;cess could take years.” &#9636;</p>
